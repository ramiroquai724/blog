Welcome, friendly visitor, to what I hope will become a collection of my ramblings on different aspects of life.
I find myself having a bit of a strange drive today. I begin this blog right on the day before I'm to be stripped of a lifelong companion.
Yes, my gallbladder is getting extracted tomorrow. Even though I trust that it tried its best for the past 31 years, it just
doesn't quite cut it anymore.
