Hello, friendly visitor. Welcome to what I hope one day will become a large collection of small ramblings on different aspects of life. 

I find myself having a bit of a strange drive to begin this blog today. Tomorrow, I'm to be stripped of a lifelong companion.
Yes, as you may have gathered from the title, I'm getting my gallbladder removed. Even though I trust that the little sucker tried its best for the past 31 years, it just
doesn't quite cut it anymore. Some would blame genetics; others, terrible dietary choices. I blame bad API design, and the subsequent anger it induces. That's a theme for a future post, though.

Farewell, my little bile pouch. Thank you for the years of service. And hello world, for you are vast and full of guacamole and chicken tenders, and other delicious things that gallbladders don't like. One door closes, another one opens up, I suppose.
